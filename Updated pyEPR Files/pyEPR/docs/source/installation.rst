Main installation method
===========================

1. **Fork** üç¥ the ```pyEPR top-level repository```_ on
   GitHub. (`How to fork a GitHub repo?`_). Share some love by
   **staring** :star: `pyEPR`_.
2. **Clone** üëá your forked repository locally. (`How to clone
   a GitHub repo?`_). Setup the ``pyEPR`` python code by following

.. _install-via_pip:

Installing locally via pip
===============================

In the future, ``pyEPR`` can be installed using the Python package manager `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_.


However, for the moment, we recommend a local develper instalation, which allows for fast upgrades. We are still in active development.
Perform the steps in the :ref:`install-main` section.
What you could do, once you have the local clone git, is to install pyEPR locally. Navigate to the local root folder of the repo.

First, in bash, upgrade python ``pip``

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install -U pip

Now we can locally install the pyEPR module.

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -e .


.. _install-via_conda:

Installing via conda
====================

For Python 3.6+, installation via `conda`_ is supported since ``pyEPR`` v.0.8.03, through the ``conda-forge`` channel. You can download and install ``pyEPR`` typing in from bash:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge pyepr-quantum

The prefix ``-c conda-forge`` is required to activate the optional ``conda-forge`` channel.

.. _install-via_pypi:

Installing via pip from PyPI
============================

For Python 3.6+, installation via `PyPI`_ is supported since ``pyEPR`` v.0.8. You can download and install ``pyEPR`` typing in from bash:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyEPR-quantum

.. note::

  Note that the name of the recipe on the ``conda-forge`` channel is ``pyepr-quantum``, and on PyPI is ``pyEPR-quantum``, as the name `pyepr` was already taken by another project. This does not change anything in the way the library is imported in Python as documented in the guide and examples.

.. _conda: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyepr-quantum
.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/pyEPR-quantum/0.8/
