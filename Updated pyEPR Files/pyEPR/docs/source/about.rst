Automated Python module for the design and quantization of Josephson quantum circuits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Abstract:** Superconducting circuits incorporating non-linear devices,
such as Josephson junctions and nanowires, are among the leading
platforms for emerging quantum technologies. Promising applications
require designing and optimizing circuits with ever-increasing
complexity and controlling their dissipative and Hamiltonian parameters
to several significant digits. Therefore, there is a growing need for a
systematic, simple, and robust approach for precise circuit design,
extensible to increased complexity. The energy-participation ratio (EPR)
approach presents such an approach to unify the design of dissipation
and Hamiltonians around a single concept — the energy participation, a
number between zero and one — in a single-step electromagnetic
simulation. This markedly reduces the required number of simulations and
allows for robust extension to complex systems. The approach is general
purpose, derived ab initio, and valid for arbitrary non-linear devices
and circuit architectures. Experimental results on a variety of circuit
quantum electrodynamics (cQED) devices and architectures, 3D and
flip-chip (2.5D), have been demonstrated to exhibit ten percent to
percent-level agreement for non-linear coupling and modal Hamiltonian
parameters over five-orders of magnitude and across a dozen samples.
Here, in this package, all routines of the EPR approach are fully
automated.
