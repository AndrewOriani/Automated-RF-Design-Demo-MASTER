    "# Demonstration of pyInventor with pyEPR and Ansys HFSS modules\n",
    "\n",
    "The following examples are given as a demonstration of automation of both 3D cavity design and HFSS simulation and analysis. To run these simulations you will need both the pyEPR module installed (these examples only work with the AndrewOriani fork of the pyEPR module) and pyInventor (https://github.com/AndrewOriani/PyInventor). After following the install instructions--and of course downloading the compatible versions of Ansys EDT and Autodesk Inventor--you will be able to run the following cells. \n",

    "## Introduction and PyInventor\n",
    "The following demonstration create a single mode flute cavity (shown below) and conducts FE electromagnetic simulations using Ansys HFSS and Q3D. \n",

    "## Eigenmode\n",
    "The cells after will demonstrate setting up of the Ansys envirnoment, importing the above design into the HFSS editor and setting up a basic eigenmode simulation. Finally the eigenmode data is printed and the field participation ratios are calculated using the calculators provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3D \n",
    "Following eigenmode is a demonstration Q3D simulations for determining the Ec of the qubit pad geometry and the C_sigma of the qubit capacitors. This extracts the capacitance matrix from Q3D and using the C_to_Ec calculator from below to determinine Ec from C_sigma. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Driven Modal for Blackbox quantization\n",
    "The next example is driven modal simulation to extract the admittance of the field at the qubit location. While formal blackbox quantization is not conducted in this example, the returned arrays of the imaginary component of the admittance (Im(Y11)) can be used to perform a semi-classical approximation of the cavity dispersively coupled to an anharmonic transmon qubit. To find more refer to:  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.0587.pdf \n",
    "\n",
    "## Eigenmode and pyEPR\n",
    "Finally I present a modified eigenmode simulation that contains a transmon qubit. This design and layout is nearly identical to that presented in the pyEPR tutorial. This does an optimetric sweep of the linear inductance of the Josephson Junction. This is passed into the pyEPR utility to then calculate the energy participation to determine the participation of the field on the junction phase and subsequently determine the properties of the coupled qubit-cavity system.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Calculators\n",
    "The first cell below are a series of calculators to analytically determine the cavity eigenmode spectrum. It determines the first n-modes of the cavity design and uses this to optimize the flute cavity dimensions to get as close as possible to the desired mode frequency. There are also functions to dtermine C_sigma of the qubit from Q3D capcitance matrices and to then determin Ec as a function of C_sigma.\n",
