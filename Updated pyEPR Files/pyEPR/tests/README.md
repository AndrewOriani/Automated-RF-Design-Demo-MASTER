# Unit Tests Module (work-in-progress)
This module is used for development unit testing, to be expandad in the future.

This is based on the python [built-in unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).
To execute a specific unit test you can run `python -m unittest test_name.py`, or to automatically run all unit tests you can run `python -m unittest`
