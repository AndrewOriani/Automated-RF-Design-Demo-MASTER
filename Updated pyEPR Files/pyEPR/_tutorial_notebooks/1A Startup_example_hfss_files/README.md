Example simulation files 
===================

In construction, please check back...

In this folder, one can find example script files to quickly start using pyEPR.
Also, take a look at the scripts folder and the tutorial folder. 
We plan to add hfss files along with the script files here. 

##### startup_example_script.py
Example startup script to perform full quantization of a two qubit, one cavity Josephson circuit.
The results are saved, printed, and nicely plotted.

##### participation_ratio.clc
An extra file for the curious person. This file has some basic expression that can be used in the fields calculator. Mostly here as a helpful utility file.
